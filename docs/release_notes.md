Release Notes
=============

2023.1.0a - October 20, 2023
----------------------------

Fixes
-----
- Fix extension loading error in camera app file


2023.1.0 - October 18, 2023
---------------------------

Additions
---------
- Add support for Warp backend task implementation
- Add Warp-based RL examples: Cartpole, Ant, Humanoid
- Add new Factory environments for place and screw: FactoryTaskNutBoltPlace and FactoryTaskNutBoltScrew
- Add new camera-based Cartpole example: CartpoleCamera
- Add new deformable environment showing Franka picking up a deformable tube: FrankaDeformable
- Add support for running OIGE as an extension in Isaac Sim
- Add options to filter collisions between environments and specify global collision filter paths to `RLTask.set_to_scene()`
- Add multinode training support
- Add dockerfile with OIGE
- Add option to select kit app file from command line argument `kit_app`
- Add `rendering_dt` parameter to the task config file for setting rendering dt. Defaults to the same value as the physics dt.

Changes
-------
- `use_flatcache` flag has been renamed to `use_fabric`
- Update hydra-core version to 1.3.2, omegaconf version to 2.3.0
- Update rlgames to version 1.6.1.
- The `get_force_sensor_forces` API for articulations is now deprecated and replaced with `get_measured_joint_forces`
- Remove unnecessary cloning of buffers in VecEnv classes
- Only enable omni.replicator.isaac when domain randomization or cameras are enabled
- The multi-threaded launch script `rlgames_train_mt.py` has been re-designed to support the extension workflow. This script can no longer be used to launch a training run from python. Please use `rlgames_train.py` instead.
- Restructures for environments to support the new extension-based workflow
- Add async workflow to factory pick environment to support extension-based workflow
- Update docker scripts with cache directories

Fixes
-----
- Fix errors related to setting velocities to kinematic markers in Ingenuity and Quadcopter environments
- Fix contact-related issues with quadruped assets
- Fix errors in physics APIs when returning empty tensors
- Fix orientation correctness issues when using some assets with omni.isaac.core. Additional orientations applied to accommodate for the error are no longer required (i.e. ShadowHand)
- Updated the deprecated config name `seq_len` used with RNN networks to `seq_length`


2022.2.1 - March 16, 2023
-------------------------

Additions
---------
- Add FactoryTaskNutBoltPick example
- Add Ant and Humanoid SAC training examples

- Add support for livestream through the Omniverse Streaming Client

Changes
-------
- Change rigid body fixed_base option to make_kinematic, avoiding creation of unnecessary articulations
- Update ShadowHand, Ingenuity, Quadcopter and Crazyflie marker objects to use kinematics

Fixes
-----
- Fix material property randomization at run-time, including friction and restitution (requires Isaac Sim update)
